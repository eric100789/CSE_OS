# Part1

## Question 1

### a
Page 0, because it's R and M are both 0.

### b
Page 2, because of earliest page.

### c
Page 1, beacause the "last reference" is earliest.

### d
Page 0. because it's R is 0.

## Question 2
sort with "Last Reference"(FIFO):
		N	G	H	D	A	L	C	B
Last Reference:	3	5	7	8	18	19	23	32
R:		1	1	1	0	1	1	0	0
M:		1	1	0	1	1	0	1	0

We can see that 'D' page's R is 0 and it is the first 0, so page D will be replaced.

## Question 3

### Virtual Address
- limited by the word length in the machine
- points to a virtual store position viewed by a process

### Physical Address
- limited by real memory size
- points to a position on a physical memory

## Question 4
The only difference of clock and second chance is the details of implementation,
so NO, there are no circumstances in which clock and second chance choose different pages to replace.

## Question 5
page0 01101110 
page1 01001001 
page2 00110111 
page3 10001011
